		<h1>Content Strategy</h1>

		<p>My site will be one page and will consist of the following sections:</p>

		<p><strong>Title with Image:</strong> The name of the group with a picture of them to introduce the user to who they will be learning about.</p>
		<p><strong>About:</strong> This section will tell the story of the group and their mission. This will follow the Why/How/What model I
											learned in prodev. The tone will be welcoming and kind to fit with the mission.</p>
		<p><strong>Biographies:</strong> This section will have each core group members (4-6) biography and corresponding picture.</p>
		<p><strong>Helpful Links:</strong> This section will link to their social media and music sharing pages.</p>
		<p><strong>Contact:</strong> This will be a form to be filled out by user to be contacted by the group via email.</p>
