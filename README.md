## PWP Feedback
### Milestone1
#### Feedback
Great job on Milestone1, your purpose, audience and goals is defined and meets project specifications. Your persona is clear and concise and gives me an understanding of your target audience. 
#### Edits/Suggestions
Im curious to see how you plan on handling the content for your site. Since you are building your site around a use-case that rely's heavily on content. I recommend focusing on how you want to highlight your content to accomplish your purpose and goals. The only part of Milestone1 that I felt lacking was your frustrations. The frustrations should highlight what value add your site will give your end user.

### Milestone 2a Feedback
Wireframes look good. The content strategy could use a little more work as far as detail is concerned. In the "About" section you mentioned that you would use the why/how/what model approach you learned in ProDev. I know what you're referring to but for projects in the future, it would be beneficial to write a few words to explain the model. The more detail you provide in any content strategy, the more it will help you with your development phase.

First item to talk about is your navbar. Are you not going to have a navbar on desktop? You wireframes on both desktop and mobile only show the hamburger menu. I suggest to revise this in a way you can have a navbar and use the links to move you to different parts of the site. Next would be the "biographies" section on mobile. Although the staggered layout works fine and looks good on desktop, you might want to consider stacking the items on smaller screens to ensure there is enough space to comfortably read the text - the horizontal space might get to narrow, so stagger only on screen sizes that can accomodate it well. 

Additional recommendations:

You might want to read ahead regarding the contact form integration, and that documentation is here: https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/class-materials/jquery-validated-captcha-form/

We'll be building PWP in a file named index.php inside of /public_html. Please note that no frontend-facing site files should live outside of the /public_html directory. Remember use an organized and standards-compliant directory structure to house all images, JavaScript, CSS, etc. We are done with the /documentation directory for now!
